RandomText
==========

A generator of random texts. Inspired by [my older project](https://github.com/aqrln/mctxtgen)
but better. Capable of dealing with a great number of words in a database.
Able to decrease chain length automatically during the generation in order to find a pattern
in the database if current one is too long. And written in Python.
